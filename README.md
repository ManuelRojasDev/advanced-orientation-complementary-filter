# advanced-orientation-complimentary-filter
This is an easy to use library meant the to calculate the orientatien angle on 3 axis.
It the angle are valued between 90 and -90 degrees.


This library works similarly as a complimentary filter. But the difference is that it uses an auto gain factor.
By adding this auto gain,this library is capable to reduce the noise when when sensor is subjected into vibrations.


It takes in accel and gyro and fuses them to calculate the orientation value of the x y and z axis. 
It also allows you to use calculate heading by providing data from a magnetic sensor.
